Introduction

Etch-a-Sketch Project, a live sketch tool on the browser that allows you to paint with various colors, sizes, and grid dimensions. While programming this project, I hope to learn how to master CSS Grid and unlock the potential of the ::hover psuedoelement.

Update 2/17/2021

Created a fully customizable grid using CSS Grid and Javascript so that user can flexibly input both dimensions and size. Dimensions and Grid Size customizable.

Update 2/18/2021

User can now paint over grid. Added different color schemes for color customization. Next I will allow user to customize whether he wants grid lines or not to get the pure sketch experience. Other ideas would be to add an eraser, or a right click to turn paint on and off to give more flexibility. Right now user only has clear entire grid option.
