Introduction

Etch-a-Sketch Project, a live sketch tool on the browser that allows you to paint with various colors, sizes, and grid dimensions. While programming this project, I hope to learn how to master CSS Grid and unlock the potential of the ::hover psuedoelement. (Edit 2/19/21: What I Learned - We don't use the hover pseudoelement at all for the grid sketch. Instead we are mainly just using javascript event listeners, mainly 'mouseover.')

Update 2/17/2021

Created a fully customizable grid using CSS Grid and Javascript so that user can flexibly input both dimensions and size. Dimensions and Grid Size customizable.

Update 2/18/2021

User can now paint over grid. Added different color schemes for color customization. Next I will allow user to customize whether he wants grid lines or not to get the pure sketch experience. Other ideas would be to add an eraser, or a right click to turn paint on and off to give more flexibility. Right now user only has clear entire grid option.

Update 2/19/2021

User can now switch to eraser mode or deactivate drawing mode, allowing more freedom in sketching. Instructions also added and icons added for both draw and erase mode.

Update 2/19/2021 7:34 PM

User can now change background of canvas. Clear button and change background merged into single button. Still have to fix bug where if we change background eraser will start drawing in that color. Also need to spruce up the buttons and inputs to make them look more interesting.

Update 2/21/2021

Icon issue fixed. Layout simplified. Next I will finish some touchups.
