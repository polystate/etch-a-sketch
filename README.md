Introduction

Etch-a-Sketch Project, a live sketch tool on the browser that allows you to paint with various colors, sizes, and grid dimensions. While programming this project, I hope to learn how to master CSS Grid and unlock the potential of the ::hover psuedoelement.

Update 2/17/2021

Created a fully customizable grid using CSS Grid and Javascript so that user can flexibly input both dimensions and size.
